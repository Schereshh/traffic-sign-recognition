# Traffic Sign Recognition
This project is made as a university assignment for Artificial Intelligence class.
The program can recognize certain traffic signs (only 16) 
```python
classes = {
0: 'Speed limit (20km/h)',  
1: 'Speed limit (30km/h)',  
2: 'Speed limit (50km/h)',  
3: 'Speed limit (60km/h)',  
4: 'Speed limit (70km/h)',  
5: 'Speed limit (80km/h)',  
6: 'End of speed limit (80km/h)',  
7: 'Speed limit (100km/h)',  
8: 'Speed limit (120km/h)',  
9: 'No passing',  
10: 'No passing vehicle over 3.5 tons',  
11: 'Right-of-way at intersection',  
12: 'Priority road',  
13: 'Yield',  
14: 'Stop',  
15: 'No vehicles',  
}
```
## Usage
- Clone the repository
- Download the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign) (**DISCLAIMER:** the dataset has been modified, to only include the first 16 classes, so if you want for you to work, you have to delete it as well, and modify the *.csv* files
- Specify the right paths for the dataset
- Download the python packages
- Run the Jupyter notebook

In the repository you can find the data model, so if you just want to evaluate it, you can skip the training part.
